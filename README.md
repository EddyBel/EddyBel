<h3 align="center">Skills</h1>

I am deeply interested in the field of artificial intelligence and information technologies. I have spent much of my time learning and deepening my knowledge in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Java, Rust and Go, as well as web frameworks.

In addition to my passion for AI, I also love working on web and mobile app development. I like to be always updated on the latest trends and tools available in these fields.
